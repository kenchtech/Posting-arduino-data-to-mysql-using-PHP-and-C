# Posting-arduino-data-to-mysql-using-PHP-and-C
# Aim: To POST arduino data variables to a webserver and save the data on a mysql database table.
# -Arduino POST to webserver
# -PHP code picks up the required variables 'temp' and 'tempc'
# -Using (file_put_contents())command the PHP script sends the transmitted data to a html webpage 'temp.html' to confirm the correct data was recieved with its time stamp. The 'temp.html' is majorly for testing and confirmation.



# Happy learning.
